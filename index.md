# Hi J-Lo

I hope you are having a splendid day. My name is Ismail Syed, I’m a third year software engineering student at Carleton University. First and foremost I would like to start off by sharing this GIF of a hedgehog with you.

You might be asking yourself “Why is this applicant sharing a hedgehog GIF with me?” All I have to say is, what other applicant starts off their cover letter with an adorable fun little hedgehog floating around in a bathtub? That’s right, none of them. :)

So now that I’ve hopefully got your attention, I am going to share my story about how programming came to be in my life. I’ll give you a little insight on how I got started, why I got started, how I continue to fuel this interest, little milestones, accomplishments and flops that I have had along the way.

### Planting the seed
When I was in grade 10, I got my first glimpse of programming. It was a nice little intro into programming through Java, nothing too crazy though. It wasn’t until grade 12 that I really started programming and experimenting with other technologies ‘outside’ the classroom. My first dive into it was with Android Development. I took the logic I had for a Black Jack card game which I had created in grade 10 and I re-created it for my Android smartphone. Around this time is when I had my first real experience of accomplishment with programming. Knowing that I had created an actual game, it may not have been super impressive but it felt really accomplishing.

### Random Hack of Kindness
September 2013 is when I started my university experience at Carleton University. My first year in university also happens to be the same year I attended my first Hackathon. This Hackathon was hosted at the old Shopify building on York Street. It was the Random Hack of Kindness Hackathon, where groups are paired up with non-profit organizations to hack up a solution to problems they generally face within their organizations.

This was my first real glimpse into realizing how much of a n00b I was at programming. At this point I had no idea what Git, GitHub or version control was. I attended the hackathon as a learning experience and oh-boy, it was quite the eye opener for me.

Nonetheless, I was very glad I went and surrounded myself with such helpful and motivating developers. It made me realize how much I still have to learn. 

### Master of the web 
In my second year (2014) of university, I got heavily involved with the IEEE Carleton student branch. I applied and got accepted for their Webmaster executive position. As their Webmaster, I maintained a linux server hosting their website. I also ran a number of workshops for students. One of which was an Introduction to web development workshop series, where I taught students the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### 50 weeks at IBM
Around this time, is also when I applied for co-op terms. I got offered a 12-month co-op at IBM as a Software Engineering.

My experience at IBM was quite amazing. I worked on a lot of front end tasks for the redesign of Cognos (a Business Analytics Platform) now known as Cognos Analytics. Throughout my co-op I worked with various designers and product managers to add new features, tweak features, update features and other various tasks. 

I also got the opportunity to propose my redesign for a component within the product which got approved. I redesigned and redeveloped a majority of the component. The component was a toolbox widget that allows Report authors to drag a drop components into their reports, a vital component for authoring reports within the product. The new toolbox I created made it to the final product and has even been marketed as a newly redesigned feature through Cognos Analytics YouTube videos!

After my 12 months of working as a co-op at IBM I returned to Carleton to finish my second year.

### Exploring entrepreneurship
After finishing my co-op and returning to school, my life sucked. I didn’t have as much time to program as before and I never was a fan of midterms and finals. So I decided to change that. 

Near the end of the semester I decided to start advertising myself as a freelance web developer through a small web development company I started called <a href="http://www.revri.ca"> Revri </a>. Here’s the logo.

Through Revri, I worked with a few startups and small businesses throughout summer 2016 on various web development tasks. I personally thought this was a really rewarding job for me. Even just knowing that I was able to advertise myself as a professional freelance web developer, acquire clients, scope out requirements for small projects, design and develop solutions for these clients; it was hands down one of the most accomplishing things that I’ve ever done.


### Cheerio 
Well J-Lo, I could keep going on in more detail, but I think I’ve rambled on for too long. I'm hoping that you will find me to be a good fit for the Shopify Developer Intern position. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
