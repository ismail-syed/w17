# Hi J-Lo

Hope you're having a splendid day. My name's Ismail, a third year Software Engineering student at Carleton University. First and foremost, let me start off by sharing this hedgehog GIF with you.

Why is this applicant sharing a hedgehog GIF with me, you might ask? Because, what other applicants start off their cover letter with a hedgehog floating around in a bath tub. That's right, none of them :)


In this cover letter, I'd like to share with you my experiences with programming. How I got started, why I got started, how I continued to fuel this interest, little milestone, accomplishments and flops along the way etc.

### Planting the seed
I got my first glimpse of programming when I was in High School in grade 10. It was nothing too crazy, a nice little intro into programming through Java. It wasn't until grade 12 that I really started programming and experimenting with other technologies 'outside' the classroom. My first dive into this was with Android Development. I took the logic I had for a Black Jack card game I created in grade 10 and re-created it for my Android smartphone. Around this time is when I had my first real experience of accomplishment with programming. Knowing that I created an actually game, even though it wasn't super amazing or impressive, was such an amazing feeling.

### Random Hack of Kindness
September 2013 is when I started my University experience at Carleton University. My first year in University also happens to be when I attended my first Hackathon. This hackthon was hosted at the old Shopify building on York Street. It was the Random Hack of Kindness Hackathon, where groups paired up with non-profit organizations to hack up a nice solution to problems they generally face in their organizations.

This was my first real glimpse into realizing how much of a n00b I was at programming. I had no idea what Git, GitHub or version control was. I attended the hackathon as a learning experience and oh-boy, it was quite the eye opener for me.

Nonetheless I was very glad I went and surrounded myself with such helpful and motivating developers.

### Master of the web 
In my second year (2014) of University, I got heavily involved with the IEEE Carleton student branch. I applied and got accepted for their Webmaster executive positon. As their Webmaster, I maintained a linux server hosting their website. I also ran a number of workshops for students. One of which was an Introduction to web development workshop series, where I taught students the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### 50 weeks at IBM
Around this time, is also when I applied for Co-op terms. I got offered a 12-month co-op at IBM as a Software Engineering. After my 12 months of working as a co-op at IBM I returned to Carleton to finish my second year.

My experience at IBM was quite awesome. I worked on a lot of front end tasks for the redesign of Cognos, a Business Analytics Platform, now known as Cognos Analytics. Throughout my co-op I worked with various designers and product managers to add new features, tweak features, etc.

I also got the opportunity to propose my redesign for a component within the product which got approved. I redesigned and redeveloped a majority of the component. The new component made it to the final product and has even been marketed as a newly redesigned feature through Cognos Analytics YouTube videos!

### Exploring entrepreneurship
After finishing my Co-op and returning to school, life sucked. I didn't have as much programming time as before and I was never a fan of midterms and finals. So I decided to change that.

Near the end of the semester I decided to start advertising myself as a freelance web developer through a small web development company I started called <a href="http://www.revri.ca"> Revri </a>. Here's the logo.

Through Revri, I worked with a few startups and small business throughout my 2016 summer on various web development tasks. Personally this was really rewarding for me. Knowing that I was able to advertise myself as a professional freelance web developer, acquire clients, scope out requirements for small projects, design and develop solutions for these clients etc. Hands down one of the most accomplishing things I've done.

### Cheerio 
Well J-Lo, I could keep going in more detail, but I think I've rambled on for long enough. Hopefully you find me to be a good fit for the Shopify Developer Intern position. Looking forward to hear from you soon!
