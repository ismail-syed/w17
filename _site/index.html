My name’s Ismail, a third year Software Engineering student at Carleton University. First and foremost, let me start off by sharing this hedgehog GIF with you.</p> <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3xz2BCohVTd7h2Kvfi/giphy.gif" alt="Hedgehog" height="42" width="42" /></p> <p>Why is this applicant sharing a hedgehog GIFS with me, you might ask? Because, what other applicant starts off their cover letter with a hedgehog floating around a bath. That’s right, none of them :)</p> <p>For this cover letter, I’d like to share with you my experience with programming. How I got started, why I got started, how I continued to fuel this interest, little milestone, accomplishments and flops along the way etc.</p> <p>I got my first glimpse of programming when I was in High School in grade 10. It was nothing too crazy, a nice little intro into Java. It wasn’t until grade 12 that I really started programming and experimenting with other technologies ‘outside’ the classroom. My first dive into this was with Android Development. I took the logic I had for a Black Jack card game I created and re-created it for my Android smartphone. Around this time is when I had my first real experience of accomplishment with programming. Knowing that I created an actually game, even though it wasn’t super amazing or impressive, was such an amazing feeling.</p> <p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/26uf2UQnd5JSci9DW.giff" alt="Happy Dance" height="42" width="42" /></p> <p>September 2013 is when I started my University experience at Carleton University. My first year in University is also when I attended my first Hackathon, which happened to be hosted at the old Shopify building on York Street. It was the Random Hack of Kindness Hackathon, where groups paired up with non-profit charities to hack up a nice solution to problems they general face in there organizations.</p> <p>This was my first real glimpse into realizing how much of a n00b I was in programming. I had no idea what Git, GitHub or version control was. I attended the hackathon as a learning experience and oh-boy, it was quite the eye opener for me.</p> <p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/rAm0u2k17rM3e.gif" alt="No Idea..." height="42" width="42" /></p> <p>Nonetheless I was very glad I went and surrounded myself with such helpful and motivating developers.</p> <p>When starting my second year (2014) of University, I got heavily involved with and eventually joined IEEE at Carleton as their Webmaster. As their Webmaster, I maintained a linux server hosting their website. I also ran a number of workshops for students. I hosted one on Introduction to web development, where I thought students the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p> <p>Around this time, is also when I applied for Co-op terms. I got offered a 12-month co-op at IBM as a Software Engineering. After my 12 months of co-op at IBM I returned to Carleton to finish my second year.</p> <p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/ZwLTpUeYVJ0fS.gif" alt="IBM" height="42" width="42" /></p> <p>My experience at IBM was quite awesome. I worked on the a lot of front end tasks for the redesign of Cognos, a Business Analytics Platform, now known as Cognos Analytics. Throughout my co-op I worked with various designers and product managers to add new features, tweak features, etc.</p> <p>I also got the opportunity to propose my redesign for a component within the product which got approved. I redesign and redeveloped the a majority of the component. The new component made it to the final product and has even been marketed as a newly redesigned feature through Cognos Analytics YouTube videos! <img src="http://i.giphy.com/102h4wsmCG2s12.gif" alt="Success" height="42" width="42" /></p> <p>After finishing my Co-op and returning to school, life sucked. I didn’t have as much programming time as before and I was never a fan of midterms and finals. So I decided to change that.</p> <p>Near the end of the semester I decided to start advertising myself as a freelance web developer through a small web development company I started called <a href="http://www.revri.ca"> Revri </a>. Here’s our logo.</p> <p><a href="http://www.revri.ca"> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/717147250732961794/nHuUGgct.jpg" alt="Success" height="42" width="42" /> </a></p> <p>Through Revri, I worked with a few startups and small business throughout my 2016 summer on various web development tasks. Personally this felt really rewarding for me. Knowing that I was able to advertise myself as a professional freelance web developer, acquire clients, scope out requirements for small projects, design and develop solutions for these clients etc. Hands down one of the most accomplishing things I’ve done.</p> <p>Well J-Lo, I could keep going in more detail, but I think I’ve rambled on for long enough. Hopefully you find me to be a good fit for the Shopify Developer Intern position. Looking forward to hear from you soon! <img src="http://i.giphy.com/KDywx24YXcY9i.gif" alt="Thank you" height="42" width="42" /></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://taylantatli.me/Halve/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script src="http://taylantatli.me/Halve/assets/js/canvas.js"></script> </body> </html>
